Welcome to the GoboLinux installer!

Follow through the steps to have the system 
installed to your hard disk. In this installer
you will be able to format the disk partition 
which will host the new system, select which 
packages should be installed and perform basic 
configuration to get your new system up and 
running.

This installer will ask you all the questions
necessary to install GoboLinux. You can go back 
and forward at any time: no real action is taken 
between screens. The installation proceeds at 
once in the end.

Note that to install GoboLinux you need an 
available partition on your hard disk (this 
installer will not modify your partition table).
If you need to check out or reconfigure your 
partitions, use QtParted on the graphical 
environment or cfdisk in the console.
